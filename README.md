QUESTION 2: Research where the data structure types are applied and give reasons why

Data structures are applied in many real-world systems to organize and manage data efficiently. Below are the main types and where they are used:

1. Array

Arrays are used in storing fixed-size data such as student marks, monthly sales records, and image pixels.

Reason:
Arrays store elements in continuous memory locations, which allows fast access using index numbers. This makes them efficient for situations where the size of data does not change frequently.

2. Linked List

Linked lists are used in music playlists, browser history, and memory management systems.

Reason:
Linked lists allow dynamic memory allocation. Elements can be easily inserted or deleted without shifting other elements. This makes them suitable for applications where data changes frequently.

3. Stack

Stacks are used in undo/redo operations, function calls in programming, and expression evaluation.

Reason:
Stacks follow the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle. This makes them suitable for applications where the most recent operation must be processed first.

4. Queue

Queues are used in printer scheduling, customer service systems, and CPU process scheduling.

Reason:
Queues follow the First In First Out (FIFO) principle. This ensures fairness and orderly processing of tasks.

5. Tree

Trees are used in file systems, database indexing, and hierarchical data storage.

Reason:
Trees organize data in a hierarchical structure. This makes searching and managing structured data faster and more efficient.

6. Graph

Graphs are used in social networks, GPS navigation systems, and network routing.

Reason:
Graphs represent relationships between different entities. They are useful when modeling connections such as roads, friendships, or communication networks.

QUESTION 3: Give examples of applications that are using the data structure type and algorithm. Give reasons why.

Many real-world applications combine data structures and algorithms to improve performance.

Google Search uses tree-based indexing structures and searching algorithms to retrieve information quickly. Trees organize large volumes of web pages efficiently, and search algorithms reduce search time.

Facebook and other social media platforms use graphs to represent users and their connections. Graph traversal algorithms such as Breadth-First Search (BFS) help in suggesting friends and finding mutual connections.

Google Maps uses graphs to represent roads and locations. It applies Dijkstra’s algorithm to find the shortest path between two locations. This helps users reach destinations faster.

Banking systems use queues to process transactions in order. Scheduling algorithms ensure that customer requests are handled fairly and efficiently.

Compilers use stacks to manage function calls and evaluate expressions. Parsing algorithms help in analyzing and translating programming code correctly.

These applications use data structures and algorithms to improve speed, efficiency, and system performance.

QUESTION 4: Research how data structures and algorithms work within systems

Data structures and algorithms form the foundation of modern computer systems. They work together to store, process, and manage data efficiently.

In operating systems, queues are used for CPU scheduling to manage processes. Linked lists are used for memory allocation and management. Trees are used to organize files and directories.

In databases, tree structures such as B-Trees are used for indexing. This allows fast searching and retrieval of records. Hash tables are also used to quickly locate stored data.

In networking systems, graphs are used to represent connections between computers and routers. Routing algorithms determine the shortest or most efficient path for data transmission.

In web applications, arrays and lists are used to store data such as user information. Trees represent the Document Object Model (DOM) structure of web pages. Stacks are used in browser navigation and program execution.

Data structures organize data, while algorithms define the steps to process that data. Together, they improve efficiency, reduce memory usage, and increase system performance.
